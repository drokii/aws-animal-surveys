# AWS Lambda learning traject - Animal Surveys

I'm doing this to learn how to set all this in AWS up myself. This being:

- Infrastructure as Code via Terraform
- Deployment of Lambdas
- Chaining Lambdas through events
- S3 Buckets, reading from them, dumping stuff in them.


### Sources
This is a list of sources I've used in this project. Will add to it as I go.
AWS Docu for lambdas in TS:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/typescript-handler.html

Terraform Documentation for setting up IaC

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws/lambda-api-gateway

Handy, if not feature-rich boilerplate from which I understood the workings of the transpiling and its configuration.
The Terraform configuration here is very in-depth.
